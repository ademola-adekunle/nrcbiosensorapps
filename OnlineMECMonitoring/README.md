# OnlineMECMonitoring

#Version 1
-Replace with old version of the MEC program

#Version 2
-RPI and Windows version still work in progress

-RPI is mostly functional, but it crashes after a period of constant running. This must be fixed.
-Windows version has one main issue which prevents functionality. Serial port management. Currently, the program is trying to open serial ports that are already open which will raise errors. Once that issue is resolved, the program should run smoothly given the above caveat.

##Current functional capabilities

###RPI
-When it hasn't crashed, the pH calibration feature and the pH control feature are both functional. The two concurent power supplies are also functional.

###Windows
-The plotting with the x-axis needs to be re-adjusted and certain the serial ports must be organized more properly or else it does not run properly.
